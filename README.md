# TwitterScraper
* A Twitter Scraper Class Using TwitterAPI v2 OAuth2.0 Access
* Python 37 with requests-oauthlib

## Structure
* [Class] ModeBuilder (for params constructure)
* [Class] TwitterScraper (scraper, with some abstract methods)
* [Class] DataDealer (for data storage)

You can modify the code (creating new inherit class) or rebuild the structure (?)

I write the codes for data to finish my project and undergraduate thesis. 

So codes may seem quite UGLY especially later ones.
